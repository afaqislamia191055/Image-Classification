This repository contains various image classification projects focused on medical applications. The projects leverage both custom-built and pretrained models to diagnose conditions from medical images. The main projects include:

**Brain Tumor Classification:**
Description: Classifies MRI images to detect and differentiate types of brain tumors.

**Pneumonia Detection:**
Description: Detects pneumonia from chest X-ray images.

**Skin Cancer Classification:**
Description: Identifies and classifies various types of skin cancer from dermatoscopic images.

**Glaucoma Classification:**
Description: Detects glaucoma from retinal images to assist in early diagnosis.
Models Used: ResNet50.

**Rooms Classification:**
Description: Classifies different types of rooms (e.g., kitchen, bedroom, bathroom) from images.
Models Used: Custom CNN, ResNet50.

Each project includes detailed Jupyter notebooks demonstrating data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions. The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with visualizations to illustrate the performance.
