This repository contains various image classification projects focused on medical applications. The projects leverage both custom-built and pretrained models to diagnose conditions from medical images. The main projects include:

**Brain Tumor Classification:**
Description: Classifies MRI images to detect and differentiate types of brain tumors.

**Pneumonia Detection:**
Description: Detects pneumonia from chest X-ray images.

**Skin Cancer Classification:**
Description: Identifies and classifies various types of skin cancer from dermatoscopic images.

Each project includes detailed Jupyter notebooks demonstrating data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions. The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with visualizations to illustrate the performance.
